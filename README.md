- Create an issue first. So we can check if the fix/update/feature is valuable (don't work for nothing 😉)
- Once we have replied to your issue, you will be able to do all the changes on your own copy of [🚀 Start UI [figma]](https://go.bearstudio.fr/start-ui-figma).
- Finally, upload your `.fig` in the issue and we will be able to update (after review of course 😜) the [main community file](https://go.bearstudio.fr/start-ui-figma).
